You should notice that there are three branches.  One for each type of data we can access in our charts. Since we are interested in Data Mine Products, expand the Data Mines Data node and follow it down. Do you notice any similarity with the other parts of Superalgos you’ve seen? That’s right! The hierarchy is organized according to Project, Exchange, Market, and Data Mine.",
